This is WAV to MP3 encoder which is written in C with using pthread, m, lame 
libs and supporting encoding folders with efficient parallel execution.

How to build
1. Linux
Be sure that you have installed standard package of lame like (libmp3lame-dev)
  or build it from sources.
Run: make. As a result you would get encoder executible and test folder which
  would contain multiple copies of test.wav file in project root.
For testing run: ./encoder test 
2. Windows
Be sure that you have installed cygwin (should work with mingw, but has not been
  tested) with all necessary stuff like gcc and make.
Cygwin does not have lame in standard repo so you would need to download, build
  and install it. Be noticed that when I was building I experienced a problem
  with ./configure due not properly working config.guess file, I had to replace
  it with more actual from /usr/share/automake-1.1x/config.guess.
Run: make. As a result you would get encoder executable and test folder which
  would contain multiple copies of test.wav file in project root.
For testing run: ./encoder.exe test

Project compiled with --static key so it should be possible to use it without
  recompilation (linux and windows prebuilt is in archive).
